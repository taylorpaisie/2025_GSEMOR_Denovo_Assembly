# Step 4: Comparing the scaffolds to other known genomes


#### We will know take our scaffolds and use [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to compare our newly assembled genome to other genomes

#### BLAST found similar genomes  
#### The closest is Pseudomonas phage CMS1, complete genome (OM937766.1), with coverage of 99% and identity of 98.53%   
#### Examination of the GenBank record for OM937766 finds that organism is "Pseudomonas phage CMS1" and the taxon ID is 2926659  
#### Another closely related genome is RefSeq NC_031063.1, Pseudomonas phage PEV2
